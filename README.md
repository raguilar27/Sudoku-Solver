# Sudoku-Solver
This sudoku solver uses python and a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to any solvable sudoku board.

With the backtracking algorithm for each empy box you will:
  1. Try all numbers 
  2. Find a number that works
  3. Repeat
  4. Backtrack - check if all numbers will work with every row and column
